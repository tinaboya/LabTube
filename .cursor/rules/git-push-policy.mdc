# Git Push Policy for Latte

## NEVER commit or push

| Path | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `MIMIC4/` | Restricted PhysioNet clinical data (23 GB) — data use agreement violation |
| `eICU/` | Restricted PhysioNet clinical data (2.2 GB) — data use agreement violation |
| `physionet.org/` | PhysioNet data files (83 MB) — restricted |
| `lab_videos/*.npy` | Generated binary data (1.6 GB) — too large, reproducible from pipeline |
| `lab_images/*.npy` | Generated binary data — reproducible from pipeline |
| `lab_videos_normalized/*.npy` | Generated binary data — reproducible from pipeline |
| `.venv/` | Python virtual environment — never committed |
| `*.log` | Log output files |
| `.DS_Store` | macOS metadata |
| `.tmp/` | Temporary files |
| `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc` | Python bytecode cache |

## ALWAYS commit and push

| Path | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `scripts/*.py` | All pipeline Python scripts |
| `docs/*.md` | Markdown reports and documentation |
| `docs/figures/` | Analysis figures (images, ~1.2 MB total) |
| `pyproject.toml` | Project metadata and dependencies |
| `requirements.txt` | Pip-compatible requirements |
| `uv.lock` | Reproducible dependency lock file |
| `frame_layout.txt` | Grid layout specification |
| `labtube.png` | Project figure |
| `lab_videos_normalized/*.json` | Small metadata JSON files |
| `.gitignore` | This repo's ignore rules |

## Before every commit

1. Run `git status` and verify no `MIMIC4/`, `eICU/`, or `*.npy` files appear as staged.
2. Run `git diff --cached --stat` to review what is being committed.
3. If any restricted data files appear, run `git reset HEAD <file>` to unstage them immediately.
